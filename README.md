# Predictive Modelling of Sales Data

We will create a machine learning model to predict whether the next product sold will be paid or unpaid. 

## Introduction:
This fake dataset is generated to illustrate essential data science techniques for developing a predictive model. The dataset is related to some sales transactions from a fictitious store. The columns of the dataset are as follows:

    - Order ID: This represents the identifier for each order. 
    - Product Name: The name of the product being sold. 
    - Quantity: The number of items for the particular product in the order.
    - Price: The price of the product. 
    - Is Paid: An indicator of whether the order has been paid for.
    
The dataset contains some messy or missing data. Given the presence of messy data, a cleaning process would be beneficial before performing any analysis or developing models based on this dataset. 

## Descriptive Analysis:
Conducting descriptive analysis on a messy dataset is crucial in understanding its characteristics and identifying areas that need cleaning or transformation. Here are some questions that you might find helpful in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this sales dataset.

### For a general understanding of the dataset, you could ask the following questions:
    1. What is this dataset about? What are the columns/features of this dataset?
    2. What are the data types of the columns? Are they consistent with what is expected of the features/columns?
    3. Are there any duplicate rows or missing values in this dataset? If so, how many are there?
    4. What is the range of values in the numerical and categorical columns? 

### For understanding of the context of the dataset, we could ask the following questions:
    1. How many unique features are present in the dataset, and what is the range of quantities sold?
    2. What is the range of prices of sold products?
    3. What proportion of orders are paid versus unpaid?
    4. Is there a correlation between the type of products being sold and whether the order is paid or unpaid? 

### For a clear idea about the quality of the dataset, you can ask the following questions:
    1. Are there any outliers or implausible data values in the dataset?
    2. How many rows and columns have invalid or implausible data values?
    3. Are there any inconsistencies in the dataset's naming of products or features?
    4. Are the column names consistent with the expected data types?

### For generating some summary statistics, we can ask the following questions:
    1. What is the average price of each product sold?
    2. What is the median quantity sold per order?
    3. What modal product is sold, and is it paid or unpaid?
    4. What is the standard deviation for the price and quantity columns?
    5. What are the skewness and kurtosis values for the numerical columns?
